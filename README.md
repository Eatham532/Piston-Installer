## What is Piston Installer?

Piston Installer is a Minecraft launcher mod installer and tool app for windows (and macOS soon [More info here](https://github.com/Eatham532/Piston-Installer#macos).)
This app is originally made for those people who for some reason don't know how to properly install mods. 

I want to make this app mostly community drivien. If you have a suggestion don't be afraid to message me on discord. 

Built using C# as a winForms project.


## UPDATE

- I am redesigning Piston Installer as it is now no longer going to be built using winForms. Now it will be made using the new MAUI. This will let me develop for both mac and windows (and maybe linux.) 



## Features
- Fabric Installer
- Modpack Installer (Only curseforge fabric packs atm)
- Mods Installer (Modrinth & Curseforge)

## Planned Features
- I want to a forge installer but forge is picky and don't want people to Auto DL it (Looking for alternatives and If you have an idea DM me)
- When you install a mod it alos downloads the extra required mods
- Install Modrinth modpacks, AtLauncher modpacks, FTB modpacks and whatever else there is...

## Stability
Right now you can use it and it will work. There will be plenty of bugs but they won't affect your results while using this.

### MacOS?

Here's the thing. My only laptop is a surface pro 7 with 128GB of storage and 8GB of ram. I am running a VM on it using VirtualBox and a MicroSD card. Expect development to be slow. I may rewrite Piston Installer later.
