## What is Piston Installer?

Piston Installer is a Minecraft launcher mod installer and tool app for windows and macOS.
This app is originally made for those people who for some reason don't know how to properly install mods on the minecraft launcher.

I want to make this app mostly community drivien. If you have a suggestion don't be afraid to message me on [discord](https://discord.gg/efQhsySt8m). 

## UPDATE

- I am redesigning Piston Installer as it is now no longer going to be built using winForms. Now it will be made using the new MAUI. This will let me develop for both mac and windows (and maybe linux.) 



## Features
- Fabric Installer
- Modpack Installer (Only curseforge fabric packs atm)

## Planned Features
- Download mods from modrinth and curseforge
- I want to a forge installer but forge is picky and don't want people to Auto DL it (Looking for alternatives and if you have an idea DM me)
- When you install a mod it also downloads the extra required mods
- Install Modrinth modpacks, AtLauncher modpacks, FTB modpacks and whatever else there is...

## Stability
You can use the most recent version. There may be bugs. The Fabric installer as a big bug but I am not bothered to fix it (Reason above) The earlier versions should work.
